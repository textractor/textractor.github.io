# Welcome to the Test of MDAI Documentation Via Jekyll and GitPages!

This is a test of what can be used to generate the MDAI project documentation.

This uses the GitHub Way of generating documentation, with local testing.

Local testing means installing Jekyll (and all of the Ruby stuff)
to build the site locally for a sanity check. Then push to the repo
to have GitHub actions build the site on the remote.

*Note:* The GitHub actions can take a few minutes to build the site.

Jekyll supports the Liquid templating language.

We're also trying out the Just the Docs theme instead of the built-in
Jekyll theme or any of the other "approved" Jekyll. Just the Docs is 
designed for documentation, is well-supported, and designed to work
in Jekyll with GitHub pages.
