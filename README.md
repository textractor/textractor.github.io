# Welcome to the Test of MDAI Documentation Via Jekyll and GitPages!

This is a test of what can be used to generate the MDAI project documentation.

This uses the GitHub Way of generating documentation, with local testing if you install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) locally.

Local testing means installing [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) locally.
Build the site locally for a sanity check. Then push to the repo
to have GitHub actions build the site on the remote.

*Note:* The GitHub actions can take a few minutes to build the site.

Jekyll supports the [Liquid templating language](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/02-liquid/).

We're also trying out the [Just the Docs theme](https://just-the-docs.com/) instead of the built-in
Jekyll theme or any of the other "approved" Jekyll. Just the Docs is 
designed for documentation, is well-supported, and designed to work
in Jekyll with GitHub pages.

[Help for setting up in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) should be pretty straight forward.
